# write a program that:
# 1. greets the user in English
# 2. asks the user to choose from 1 of 3 spoken languages (pick your favorite languages!) 
# 3. displays the greeting in the chosen language
# 4. exits

# make sure that your code contains comments explaining your logic!

 #I assigned what the user types in as language with the three outcomes since it is the language you are changing after all.
